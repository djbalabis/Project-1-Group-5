# Restaurant-R-Us

## Description

The website that we have developed is a place for users to find restaurants nearby whatever location they are interested in exploring the cuisine of. People in an unfamiliar area looking to find good food nearby or even people familiar with their area who want to try something new will appreciate this website that allows them to locate nearby restaurants around whatever address they choose. It can be a problem for people to fully understand the food in their area without the existence of an external site because without that the only way to find out is word of mouth or just by exploring, and not every person has access to both. This website solves this problem by creating a location that shows you every restaurant near your location. Through the creation of this website we learned how to implement a website that uses more than one external API and an html framework other than bootstrap.

## Installation

The intended use of this website is for the user to interact with it via a web browser of their choosing. The wesbsite was built using microsoft visual studio and git bash software.

## Usage

Using the Restaurnt-Pedia website is very simple. The Website features a search box for the user to enter addresses. The user inputs their desired address via the search bar, which then shows said address and nearby stores on the map featured on the website. The user can then decide amongst these websites and choose which restaurant they would like to patronize.
