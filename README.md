# Recipes-R-Us

## Description

The website that we have developed is a place for users to find recipes for dishes they'd like. Many times people see certain meals on social media, and always think "but how do i make it?". This website solves this problem by creating a list of recipes for the desired type of food you're craving. Through the creation of this website we learned how to implement a website that uses an external API and an html framework other than bootstrap.

## Installation

The intended use of this website is for the user to interact with it via a web browser of their choosing. The wesbsite was built using microsoft visual studio and git bash software.

## Usage

Using the Recipes R Us website is very simple. The Website features a search box for the user to enter a specific food (fish, chicken, beef etc.). The user inputs their desired meal or dish, a list of 10 different recipes appear with links to an external website that has details in regards of ingredients to use in order to create the desired meal they choose.
